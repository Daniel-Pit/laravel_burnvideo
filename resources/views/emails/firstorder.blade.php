<p>Hi {{$username}},</p>
<p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for supporting my business and for trusting Burn Video with your precious videos and pictures! I started this company in 2015 when I realized I took tons of videos of my children on my cellphone and didn’t have a way to keep them safe; and, we never watched them once they were recorded! It’s as if they were locked away in my phone, never to be viewed again. I remember those late nights working with developers and engineers to bring my vision of an “easy-to-use” app to conception. I am so thankful each time someone places an order from the app or the website and I know you are trusting me to preserve your memories! I know you work hard for your money and am grateful that you find my company’s services worthy of spending your money on.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting me and my vision! If you have any questions or if there is anything that our Customer Service department can help you with, please do not hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:questions@burnvideo.net" target="_top">questions@burnvideo.net</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your day!</p>
